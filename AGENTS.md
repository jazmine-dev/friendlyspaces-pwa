## Android CLI Workflow (WSL -> Windows USB Device)

For building and installing Android from this WSL environment, follow:

- `docs/android-wsl-adb-runbook.md`

This is the source of truth for:

- `adb` command path usage from WSL
- Capacitor sync flow
- Windows-side Gradle build from mirrored repo path
- APK install/launch commands for USB testing
